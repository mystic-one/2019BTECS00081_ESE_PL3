          Each year, the United States averages some 10,000 thunderstorms, 5,000
           floods, 1,300 tornadoes and 2 Atlantic hurricanes, as well as widespread
            droughts and wildfires.
           Weather, water and climate events, cause an average of approximately 650
            deaths and $15 billion in damage per year and are responsible for some
             90 percent of all presidentially-declared disasters. About one-third of
              the U.S. economy – some $3 trillion – is sensitive to weather and
             climate. National Weather Service (NWS) provides weather, hydrologic,
             and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories,
             adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property
              and the enhancement of the national economy.
